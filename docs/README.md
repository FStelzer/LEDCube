LEDCube project - like all the other LED Cubes but using PCBs and therefore much simpler to solder.

Kit contains 4 different parts:
 - Mainboard (largest one) -> goes on the bottom, components facing down
 - 4x Columns - go vertical up from the mainboard
 - 8x Rows A - 4x LEDs on each - connect to column boards
 - 8x Rows B - 4x LEDs on each - connecto to column boards

See images/ folder first to see what the result should look like and sort your parts and try to fit them together without solder first!

Check if all column boards fit through the slots in the mainboard. Sometimes they need a little bit of scraping/sanding on the edges to fit easily.
Similar for the rows connecting to the columns, check if they all fit. Usually those can simply be pushed in.

Then solder 4 identical rows to each column board. The columns have an arrow printed on it. This is lower end next to the mainboard. Make sure all the LED on the rows point upwards when soldering them to the columns.
When adding a row to a column add a single solder joint first, then heat up and adjust so everything is straight. Only then add all the remaining joints.
Note that every row has up to 8 joints to the column boards (top and bottom side). Some rows only allow for 6. This is expected and due to routing issues.
Simply solder every possible connection and leave the ones without corresponding pads.
This should give you four grids with two different versions. One Version slightly shifted to the right and one to the left.

Same procedure then soldering the columns to the main board. Start with the inner 2 columns.
Like the rows, again only one joint first, then reheat & align, then the other joints.
The column boards at the bottom have 4 Joints on Top and also 4 on the Bottom. Start with the ones on top for easier alignment.
The rows have a small white arrow printed on them. This arrows needs to point towards the printed white line on the mainboard (see pictures).
Make sure to have each column the same distance through the mainboard or the end result will not be level.
